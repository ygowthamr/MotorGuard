# Motor Overheat Protection System

An **ESP32-based system** that monitors motor temperature and **automatically shuts it down** if overheating is detected. It also **sends real-time alerts** via the Blynk mobile app.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Real-time **temperature monitoring** using an LM35 sensor.  
- **Automatic motor cut-off** to prevent overheating.  
- **Instant alerts** via the Blynk mobile app.  
- **Remote monitoring** from anywhere.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **ESP32** – Microcontroller for processing data.  
- **LM35 Temperature Sensor** – Measures temperature.  
- **Relay Module** – Controls motor shutdown.  
- **Blynk Mobile App** – Sends real-time alerts.  
- **C++ (Arduino)** – ESP32 programming.  

## 🔧 Setup  
1. Connect ESP32, LM35, and Relay Module.  
2. Upload the code to ESP32.  
3. Set up Blynk for remote monitoring.  
4. Start monitoring and preventing motor overheating!
